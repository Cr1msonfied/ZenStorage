# ZenStorage

**ZenStorage** is a repository where users can upload and share their **ZPP**, **ZPU**, and **GPC** scripts through Discord, hosted directly on GitHub Pages. This project is designed to become a central hub for the community to share and find scripts for their Zen devices.

## Backstory

My journey on GitHub has been a rollercoaster, marked by success, challenges, and, more recently, setbacks. My original GitHub account was **crimsonfiedOfficial**, but now I’m back with **Cr1msonfied**. I was falsely accused of uploading malware onto GitHub to distribute. Thing is, I was recently ratted and banned unfairly. I believe it was the rat that uploaded that malware onto my GitHub, which led to my suspension.

Despite this, I refuse to give up on my projects. Throughout my time on GitHub, I’ve managed and contributed to several successful initiatives. One of my most notable projects was **ConfigStorage**, a repository specifically for Roblox Bedwars Exploiting (Vape V4 Client) configs. It was a popular platform, providing users with the scripts and configurations they needed for their gameplay experience. I hope to bring this project back in a new and improved form in the future.

Now, I’m turning my focus to **ZenStorage**, a new platform designed to serve the Zen community in the same way **ConfigStorage** did for Roblox Bedwars users.

## Features

- **Upload and Share**: Users can upload ZPP, ZPU, and GPC scripts through Discord.
- **Centralized Repository**: All scripts will be hosted and accessible via GitHub Pages.
- **Community-Driven**: Built with contributions from the Zen scripting community.

## Future Goals

As I look forward, my goal is to make **ZenStorage** just as successful as my past projects. The community's support has always been at the heart of my work, and I hope that this project becomes another useful tool for everyone involved. 

Stay tuned, as I’ll also be working on bringing **ConfigStorage** back in a new and improved form.

## How to Contribute

Join our Discord community to upload your scripts! All contributions are welcome, and I’m excited to see what everyone will bring to the platform.
